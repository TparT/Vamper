**_IN ORDER FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK MAKE SURE YOU:_**

- Make sure to add client id and access token in the config.json file otherwise it wont work!

- You can get the client id and access token from this website: https://twitchtokengenerator.com/
   basically select 'bot chat token' although Vamper is not a bot but whatever Okayge,
   and log in with a Twitch account, doesn't have to be your main account, any account will work just fine.
   and then scroll down and click the green "Generate Token!" button.
   Then authorize, and your client id and access token should be infront of you :D

- Put the correct channel id in the config.json file of the channel you want to monitor!
